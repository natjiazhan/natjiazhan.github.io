This summer, I would like to create some interesting projects centered around the FPGA. Some ideas I have started playing around with are gaussian splatting and 3D point rendering. 

I would also like to implement a microprocessor on the FPGA that can take inputs from a keyboard and output to a VGA display.

More updates to come.
