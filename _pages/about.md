Welcome to my personal website! I am an Honors Electrical Engineering Student and President of the Chinese American Student Association at Arizona State University. I am pursuing both my Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical Engineering with the 3+1 and aim to have both by the end of 2027. My interests lie in Digital Design, Computer Architecture, Semiconductors, and Machine Learning. Outside of academia, I enjoy weightlifting, swimming, and video editing.
